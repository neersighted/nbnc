nbnc
====

a simple null (transparent) bnc

nbnc is simply an IRC-aware TCP proxy, or BNC. It uses IRC-style authentication
(`PASS`) for compatibility with existing IRC clients. It is intended for use
cases where you want to disguise your true host or apply a vanity hostname. I
wrote it for personal use with [IRCCloud], a hosted BNC service with a web
interface.
